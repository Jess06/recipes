California Roll

Developed in Los Angeles sometime in the 1960s, the California roll is a favorite among those who enjoy maki sushi. This recipe from Natasha’s Kitchen takes about 80 minutes, including rice cooking, and yields 9 rolls.

Ingredients:

½ pound imitation crab meat
1 avocado, ripe but still firm
½ medium cucumber, peeled and sliced into long Julienne strips
Toasted nori seaweed
Toasted sesame seeds
Directions: Wrap sushi mat in plastic wrap. Fold pieces of nori in half to split them.

Toast sesame seeds over medium heat, stirring constantly until golden. Slice vegetables. Spread a generous handful of sushi rice onto the half sheet of nori. Use wet fingertips to spread the rice evenly over the entire surface of the nori.

Flip the rice-covered piece of nori over so the rice is facing down. Place your fillings across the center of your rice in the middle of the sheet. Try to avoid over-filling!

Start rolling firmly away from you using the sushi mat. Once the roll is complete, sprinkle the roll with toasted sesame seeds while it is still on the mat so you can turn it easily.

Run your sharp knife through a damp paper towel before slicing so the rice won’t stick as much. Cut the roll in half, then line the two halves up and slice even 1-inch rings.
